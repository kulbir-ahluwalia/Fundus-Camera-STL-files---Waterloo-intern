# Fundus-Camera-STL-files---Waterloo-intern
Solidwork files for the 3D printable Fundus camera desgned in the University of Waterloo, Canada. This work was done during my internship with Dr Simarjeet Singh Saini during March-July 2018.

# STL files can be viewed in 3D
Just **go in the STL files folder** and **click on any .stl file.** 
These .stl files were generated using **Solidworks** and were used with the 3D printing sofware **CURA** for 3D printing the prototypes using the **Ultimaker 3** 3D printer.
